   	    <form>
		    <p>
                Example using a single input form field to hold all the tag values, instead of one per tag (see settings.singleField).
                This method is particularly useful if you have a form with one input field for comma-delimited tags that you want to trivially "upgrade" to this fancy jQuery UI widget.
                This configuration will also degrade nicely as well for browsers without JS &mdash; the default behavior is to have one input per tag, which does not degrade as well as one comma-delimited input.
            </p>
            <p>
                Normally this input field will be hidden &mdash; we leave it visible here so you can see how it is manipulated by the widget:
                <input name="tags" id="mySingleField" value="Apple, Orange" disabled="true"> <!-- only disabled for demonstration purposes -->
            </p>
		    <ul id="singleFieldTags"></ul>
			<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	    </form>

        <hr>
        <h3><a name="graceful-degredation"></a>Single Input Field (2)</h3>
   	    <form>
		    <p>
                If you instantiate Tag-it on an INPUT element, it will default to being singleField, with that INPUT element as the singleFieldNode. This is the simplest way to have a gracefully-degrading tag widget.
            </p>
            <input name="tags" id="singleFieldTags2" value="Apple, Orange">
			<input type="submit" value="Submit">
	    </form>
